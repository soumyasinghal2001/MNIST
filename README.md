The MNIST (Modified National Institute of Standards and Technology) dataset is a widely used benchmark dataset in machine learning and deep learning. It consists of 70,000 grayscale images of handwritten digits (0-9), each 28x28 pixels in size. The dataset is divided into 60,000 training images and 10,000 testing images. MNIST is commonly used for tasks like image classification and pattern recognition, serving as a beginner-friendly dataset to test and evaluate models.
